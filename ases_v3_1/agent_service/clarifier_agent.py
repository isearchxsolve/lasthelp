ASES - Requirement Clarifier (Gap Fix #3)
==========================================
Solves: Underspecified tasks that cause the planner to make wrong assumptions,
leading to a technically correct but functionally wrong deliverable.

Problem in v2.5:
    Task: "Build a dashboard"
    Planner assumes: React SPA with charts
    Client wanted: Admin panel with user management
    Tests pass on iteration 1. Wrong product delivered.

    There is currently no pre-flight check on task clarity. The system
    accepts any string and runs the full pipeline.

Solution:
    clarifier_agent() runs BEFORE the planner. It:
    1. Scores the task on 4 specificity dimensions (0-10 each)
    2. If the total score < CLARITY_THRESHOLD, returns CLARIFICATION_NEEDED
       with a ranked list of questions
    3. If the task is clear enough, returns PROCEED with inferred assumptions
       injected back into the requirements string

    The caller (main.py route handler or n8n webhook) decides whether to:
    - Block and return questions to the user (interactive mode)
    - Proceed with inferred assumptions logged (autonomous mode)
    - Use a per-tenant threshold to control when to block vs infer

Integration:
    In agent_loop.py _dev_pipeline(), before planner_agent():

        clarity = await clarifier_agent(task, tech_stack, requirements, config, execution_id)

        if clarity["action"] == "CLARIFICATION_NEEDED" and config.require_clarity:
            return {
                "success": False,
                "clarification_needed": True,
                "questions": clarity["questions"],
                "clarity_score": clarity["score"],
            }

        # Augment requirements with inferred assumptions either way
        requirements = clarity["augmented_requirements"]

    In TenantConfig (models.py), add:
        require_clarity: bool = False       # set True for interactive tenants
        clarity_threshold: float = 5.0      # 0-10, below this = ask questions
