"""Emergency humanitarian tools — TAKE ACTION immediately, not just suggest.

Design: every tool runs live web searches, builds a prioritised action list,
and returns `executed_actions` with clickable markdown links.  The synthesizer
turns these into a "DO THIS NOW" response with real hyperlinks the user can
click in the Gradio / web UI.  We do NOT call webbrowser.open() because OMEGA
runs on a server — instead we embed the URLs directly in the output so the
user's browser opens them.

Now uses domain-agnostic automation capabilities from automation.py for:
- Browser automation (Playwright)
- Phone calls (Twilio)
- Country detection
